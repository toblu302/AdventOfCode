# Brainfuck

Add a newline to the end of your input-file, and pipe it to your favourite Brainfuck interpreter, running the part1 code. The program does not actually output anything, so check the content of cell -11 (assuming cell 0 is the starting cell) with a debugger or something. The program does not terminate either and might either crash or run forever. I don't really plan to fix this.
