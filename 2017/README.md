## AoC 2017
These solutions for Advent of Code 2017 are written in Python 3.

### Structure
Each day has its own folder, with the solutions for part 1 and 2 placed in the files part1.py and part2.py. If there are unit tests for the day, these are located in tests.py. My input for any given day is located in the file named "input". Each solution read from standard input and print out the answer to standard output. Use pipes to pass the input to the program, i.e "python3 part1.py < input".
